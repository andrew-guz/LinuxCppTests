+ Problem: wrong id for Connection Information:
+ Print Project when BackEnd starts
+ BackEnd Resources - check return result - no entity - bad request
+ FrontEnd - empty message may be an error
+ verify Uuid copy operation

Later:
+ get property value easier
+ entity pool - double call in front end - allow disable
+ switch on or off entity pool usage and serializer maybe return shared_pointer
+ add waiting window (+counter in it)
+ more fields from original application in Project
-+ automate adding new data types to factory
+ save order of properties as they were added
- generate UI from fields (at least partially)
- erorr in generate UI from fields - order of fields
- field update logic
- open project
- save project
- crc?
